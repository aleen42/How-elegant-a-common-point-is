## How elegant a common point is
###中文
- &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;我們有時會發現, 我們所學的某些知識能找到其在生活中相通的地方. 這個相通的地方, 我稱其為一個 **"相通點"** (即問題的解決與某生活現象聯繫到同一個點上). 這些相通點, 可以讓我們學會如何在生活中找到一些現象, 去啟發我們解決問題的思路. 慢慢地, 當你發掘越來越多相通點的時候, 你將會發現它們將是多麼的優雅. 為了更好地闡述我所認為的**相通點**, 我舉出一個例子:

#####例子一
- &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;現象: 假設有一篇**文章**和一張**照片**, 它們都是用來描述某女士的外貌特徵, 如**頭髮**, **身高**, **服飾顏色**等, 那麼你會發現短暫的一瞬間後, 對於看圖片的人來說, 他們對該女士印象遠比看文章的人要深刻. 
- &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;原理: 眼球的**感光細胞**構造, 使得我們可以在短時間內, 看到圖像時會併發地接受圖像所帶來的信息. 相比之下, 文字是順序的排布, 使得我們並不能併發地接受信息.
- &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;**相通點**(某問題的解決方案): 可视化建模, 即用圖像代替長篇的文章來描述一個模型. 它的提出成功的解決了文本建模所帶來的不直觀性.

#####例子二
- &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;現象: 當一個小孩心智不成熟時, 他並不能反饋信息給你, 如他吃完飯並不會主動讓你知道他已經吃完了, 這時候家長就會不斷地去諮詢該小孩是否已經吃完了. 然而如果該小孩長大到一定程度, 他有了反饋信息的能力時, 家長只需要等待小孩的反饋便可.
- &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;**相通點**(某問題的解決方案): CPU處理IO事件根據外設的反饋能力設計有兩種策略. 一種是輪詢, 一種是中斷. 所謂輪詢, 指的是CPU不斷諮詢外設IO事件是否完成, 因該種外設不存在反饋功能; 而中斷, 則是指外設處理好IO事件後, 主動反饋給CPU(通過產生中斷消息並發給CPU).

###English
- Sometimes we find that what we have learnt will find their 'place' in our daily life. The place is called **'a common point'** by me. That means a solution to a problem and a phenomenon in our daily life have crossed at a same point.  These common points can help us to learn how to solve problems with phenomenons in our daily life. Gradually, you will find how elegant they are after you have found so many these points. To make it understood, I would like to give you an example:

#####Example1
- Phenomenon: Assume that there are a **text** and a **photo**, both to describe what a lady looks like. After a short time, you will have a conclusion that the lady is more impressive for people, who have watched the photo, than others, who have watched the text.
- Theory: Because of the composition of **photoreceptor**(a kind of cells) in our eyes, we will concurrently accept information from an image, making us impressive during a short time, while information from a text is sequentially accepted.
- **Common points**(a solution to a special problem): Visual Modelling, which uses an image to describe a model instead of using a text. It has solved the problem that text cannot describe a model intuitively.

#####Example2
- Phenomenon: When a child is too young, he doesn't have the ability to tell parents that he have eaten all the rice. Under this condition, parents should constantly ask children whether rice have already been eaten. With the child growing up, he will be able to give a feedback to parents.
- **Common points**(a solution to a special problem): There are two strategies in CPU for handling IO events, based on the ability of peripherals to feedback. 
	- Programed IO: To constantly ask peripherals whether they have done IO events.
	- Interrupt IO: Peripherals will automatically give a feedback to CPU with interruptions when IO events have been done.
