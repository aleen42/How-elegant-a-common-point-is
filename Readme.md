## How elegant a common point is
###中文
- &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;我們有時會發現, 我們所學的某些知識能找到其在生活中相通的地方. 這個相通的地方, 我稱其為一個 **"相通點"**. 慢慢地, 當你發掘越來越多相通點的時候, 你將會發現它們將是多麼的優雅. 為了更好地闡述我所認為的**相通點**, 我舉出一個例子:

#####例子一
- &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;現象: 假設有一篇**文章**和一張**照片**, 它們都是用來描述某女士的外貌特徵, 如**頭髮**, **身高**, **服飾顏色**等, 那麼你會發現短暫的一瞬間後, 對於看圖片的人來說, 他們對該女士印象遠比看文章的人要深刻. 
- &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;原理: 眼球的**感光細胞**構造, 使得我們可以在短時間內, 看到圖像時會併發地接受圖像所帶來的信息. 相比之下, 文字是順序的排布, 使得我們並不能併發地接受信息.
- &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;相通點: 可视化建模, 即用圖像代替長篇的文章來描述一個模型.

###English
- Sometimes we find that what we have learnt will find their 'place' in our daily life. The place is called **'a common point'** by me. Gradually, you will find how elegant they are after you have found so many these points. To make it understood, I would like to give you an example:

#####Example1
- Phenomenon: Assume that there are a **text** and a **photo**, both to describe what a lady looks like. After a short time, you will have a conclusion that the lady is more impressive for people, who have watched the photo, than others, who have watched the text.
- Theory: Because of the composition of **photoreceptor**(a kind of cells) in our eyes, we will concurrently accept information from an image, making us impressive during a short time, while information from a text is sequentially accepted.
- Common points: Visual Modelling, which uses an image to describe a model instead of using a text.
